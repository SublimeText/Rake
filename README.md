Description
===========
[Rake](http://rake.rubyforge.org/) is a simple ruby build program with capabilities similar to make. This package adds support to Sublime Text for developing Ceedling applications.

Rake has the following features:

* Rakefiles (rake‘s version of Makefiles) are completely defined in standard Ruby syntax. No XML files to edit. No quirky Makefile syntax to worry about (is that a tab or a space?)
* Users can specify tasks with prerequisites.
* Rake supports rule patterns to synthesize implicit tasks.
* Flexible FileLists that act like arrays but know about manipulating file names and paths.
* A library of prepackaged tasks to make building rakefiles easier.

Package Installation
====================
**Preferred:** Using [Package Control](https://sublime.wbond.net/), select `Package Control: Install` in the Command Palette, search for `Rake`, and hit Enter.

To clone manually, bring up a command line in the `Packages/` folder of your Sublime user folder (locate it using **`Preferences -> Browse Packages...`**), and execute the following:

    git clone git://github.com/SublimeText/Rake.git

When you launch Sublime Text, it will pick up the contents of this package so that you can consume the goodness that it provides.

Features
========
* Adds a `Rake.sublime-build` that will simply execute 'rake' with no arguments (default task)
* The `rake.py` Sublime Text plugin adds a `rake` Sublime Text command that can be used in any custom keybindings and/or menu items.
	* Automatically calls the proper flavor of rake per OS (e.g. `rake` on OSX and Linux; `rake.bat` on Windows)
	* The `rake` command is based off of the `exec` command, but takes different parameters
		* e.g. the `"cmd"` parameter is replaced by:
			* `"prefix"` - text/parameters to be tacked on prior to `rake` on the command line (e.g. [`"bundle"`, `"exec"`])
			* `"tasks"` - array of tasks to be executed in order (e.g. ["clobber", "test:all"])
			* `"options"` - array of extra parameters to be appended after the tasks (e.g [`"--trace"`])
		* Most of the other parameters supported by the 'exec' command are supported as well:
			* `"file_regex"`
			* `"line_regex"`
			* `"working_dir"`
			* `"env"`

Planned Features
================
* Dynamically create entries in the Command Pallette for described rake tasks

Example Usage
-------------
Key Binding:

    { "keys": ["f4"], "command": "rake", "args": {"tasks": ["clobber", test:all"] } }

Result: (pressing F4 will execute the following):

    rake clobber test:all
